OOP, Design Patterns, JUnit, Mockito, maven etc.
Project: implementation of PointOfSale.

The code coverage screen is present in the project folder.

Patterns: Singleton (simple implementation, not with lazy initialization, not double check locking, not enum etc), ChainOfResponsibility(for handlers), Builder (for Point Of Sale construction).

According to the requirments no any other classes and libraries should be used except java sdk and testing libs.
So no any interaction with real DB (which needs jdbc driver). No any interaction is present with real monitor, printer, scaner.
